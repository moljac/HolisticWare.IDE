### ScreenSnapshot ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Uses Quartz Display Services to obtain an image containing the contents of any of the connected displays. When the user selects a display item from the 'Capture' menu, a screen snapshot image is obtained and displayed in a new document window. The user can then save the image to disk in any of the supported formats (jpeg, png, tiff). Also installs a callback function that's invoked whenever the configuration of a local display is changed. This is used to update the 'Capture' menu  display items.
